# The Little Book of Semaphores

This is a book for more synchronization problems for further study if you have
learned OS.

It's a free book. You can find in [here](https://greenteapress.com/wp/semaphores/). It's really wonderful.

Because this book is written mostly by pseudo code. I'll write the code in Python with semaphores,
and write the code in C with mutexes and conditional variables
using `pthread`.
