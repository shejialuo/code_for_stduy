# Network

There are three types of attacks we concern about.

+ Confidentiality: eavesdropping (aka sniffing)
+ Integrity: injection of spoofed packets
+ Availability: delete legit packets (e.g., jamming)

## TCP

### Eavesdropping

For subnets using broadcast technologies, attacker can eavesdrop.

+ Each attached system's NIC can capture any communication on the subnet.
+ Tools: `tcpdump`/`windump`, wireshark.

### Spoofing

Attacker can inject spoofed packets, and lie about the source address:

+ With physical access to local network, attacker can create any packet they like.
+ Particularly powerful when combined with eavesdropping, because attacker can
understand exact state of victim's communication and craft their spoofed traffic
to match it.

### On-path vs Off-path Spoofing

+ On-path attackers can see victim's traffic => spoofing is easy.
+ Off-path attackers can't see victim's traffic
  + They have to resort to blind spoofing
  + Often must guess/infer header values to succeed.
  + There is a possibility to brute force.

### Abrupt Termination

When A sends a TCP packet with RST flag to B and sequence number fits, connection
is immediately terminated.

So the attacker can inject RST packets and block connection. Well, unfortunately,
the GFW does this to TCP requests. The on-path attacker and man-in-the-middle
can do this attack.

### Data Injection

If attacker knows *ports* and *sequence numbers* (on-path attacker), attacker can
inject data into any TCP connection, termed *connection hijacking*.

### Blind Hijacking

It is also possible for off-path attacker to inject into a TCP connection even if
they can't see the port and sequence numbers because they could infer or guess
the port and sequence numbers.

### Blind Spoofing on TCP handshake

When the attacker wants to do blind spoofing on TCP handshake, the attacker could
send a packet to the server. There are two situations here:

+ If alleged client receives the response from the server, the alleged client
will be confused, sends a RST back to server. So attacker may need to hurry!
But firewalls may inadvertently stop this reply to the alleged client so
it never ends the RST.
+ It's a problem for attacker to get the value of the `seq` field of the response,
in the older time, the value could be guessed, now the value is total random. This
is the reason why `seq` fields need to random.

### Summary

+ An attacker who can observe your TCP connection can manipulate it:
  + Forcefully terminate by forging a RST packet.
  + Inject (spoof) data into either direction by forging data packets
  + Remains a major threat today
+ Blind spoofing no longer a thread
  + Due to randomization of TCP initial sequence numbers.

## DHCP

There are many threats for DHCP

+ Substitute a fake DNS server
  + Redirect any of a host's lookups to a machine of attacker's choice
+ Substitute a fake gateway router
  + Intercept all of a host's off-subnet traffic
  + Relay contents back and forth between host and remote server
+ An invisible Man In The Middle

Thus, we can conclude the following ideas:

+ Broadcast protocols inherently at risk of local attacker spoofing.
+ When initializing, systems are particularly vulnerable because they can lack
a trusted foundation to build upon.
+ MITM attacks insidious because no indicators they're occurring.

## TLS

### Building Secure End-to-End Channels

+ End-to-end = communication protections achieved all the way
from originating client to intended server.
+ Dealing with threads
  + Eavesdropping: Encryption
  + Manipulation (injection, MITM): Integrity(use of a Mac); replay protection
  + Impersonation: Signatures.

### RSA

+ Browser constructs "Premaster Secrete" PS.
+ Browser sends PS encrypted using Amazonâ€™s public RSA key.
+ Using PS, $R_{B}$, and $R_{s}$, browser and server derive symm.
cipher keys $(C_{B}, C_{S})$ and MAC integrity keys $(I_{B}, I_{S})$.
+ Browser and server exchange MACs computed over entire dialog so far.
+ If good MAC, browser display green lock.

### Diffie-Hellman

![Diffie-Hellman TLS](https://s2.loli.net/2022/06/17/Nm1KajUnkXefZbh.png)

+ Server generates random $a$, sends public params and $g^a \mod p$.
+ Browser verifies signature using PK from the certificate.
+ Browser generates random $b$, computes $g^{ab} \mod p$, sends to server.
+ Server also computes $g^{ab} \mod p$.
+ As before.

## Denial of Service (DoS)

There are attacks on availability:

+ Denial-of-Service: preventing legitimate users from using a computing service.
+ Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) occurs when a server is
flooded with traffic from many different devices.

There are some basic approaches to do attacks on availability:

+ Deny service via a *program flaw*.
+ Deny service via *resource exhaustion*.
+ Network-level DoS vs application-level DoS.

### Network-level DoS

We could exhaust network resources by

+ Flooding with lots of packets (brute-force)
+ DDoS: flood with packets from may sources.
+ Amplification: abuse patsies who will amplify your traffic for you.

### Transport-Level Denial-of-Service

TCP's 3-way connection establishment handshake used to agree on initial
sequence numbers. So a single SYN from an attacker suffices to force
the server to spend some memory. This is called TCP SYN Flooding.

![TCP SYN Flooding](https://s2.loli.net/2022/06/17/Jd5Vsbr3RflpOZt.png)

+ Attacker targets memory rather than network capacity.
+ Every (unique) SYN that the attacker sends burdens the target.

How should we defense this, the answer is simple: don't keep state!

When SYN arrives, rather than keeping state locally, send it to the client.
And the client needs to return the state in order to established connection.
The problem is that how to store the state, so the server encode connection
entirely within SYN-ACK sequence, which is called *SYN cookie*.
